            These CCEs are typically 10th to 12th pass and speak to customers over the phone to remind them about upcoming or overdue vehicle services.
            Your job is to generate 5 simple, spoken-style pitch points that a CCE can use during a follow-up call to:
            Remind the customer that their vehicle service is due.
            Encourage them to book a service appointment.
            Highlight useful benefits that TVSM offers (to build interest and trust).
            How You Should Generate the Pitch:
            Use simple words, short sentences, and conversational tone.
            Mention TVSM benefits that are relevant to the customer, like:
            Free pick-up and drop for service
            AMC plans to reduce service cost
            Service by trained TVS technicians
            Quick repair services
            Use  relatable language (avoid complicated English).
